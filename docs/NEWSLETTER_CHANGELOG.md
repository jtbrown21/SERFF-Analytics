# State Newsletter Template Changelog

## Updates for May 2025
- Synced layout and copy with `dev/agent_report_v5.html`.
- Stats section now shows **Carriers Tracked** instead of states.
- CTA copy updated ("switch" -> "shop", "Win back lost customers" -> "Win back customers").
- Large numbers use shortened formatting (e.g., `4.1K`, `2.3M`).
- Carrier count is dynamically queried from DuckDB.
